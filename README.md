# Oyster Card

### [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com) - Week 2 Pair Programming Project

## Outline
This program keeps track of the balance on a user's Oyster Card. The program allows a user to add money to the card (as long as it doesn't surpass the maximum balance) and subtracts money from the card at the end of the user's journey depending on how far the user traveled. The user is also able to view all of their previous trips and look up what zone a specific station is in. The program is also able to charge the user a penalty fair if they forget to touch in or out at the station. 

## The Task
I used this project to practice TDD and OOP. I used the User Stories that are liste below to determine which Objects and Methods I needed to create. After creating the needed Objects and Methods, I wrote feature tests (tested using IRB) and followed up with unit tests (tested using RSPEC). The goal making all RSPEC tests pass by the end of the project was achieved.
